== What is this?
This is an example project which shows how a MQTT wildcard subscriber which stores all messages to a MySQL database
could be implemented.

== Why was Paho bundled with the code?

At the time of the writing, Paho was not yet mavenized. Since Maven is awesome (or at least one of the not-so-sucky
build systems), we bundled Paho in a Maven file repository with this code.

== Is this production ready?

Probably not, this is a proof of concept. However, this example project could get you started quickly for implementing
a real world application. We recommend to use a sane Logging Library (like Logback) and upgrading to the latest Paho
version. Probably Paho is already mavenized when you read this, make sure you check Maven central.
